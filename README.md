# Generate **RSS 1.0**, **RSS 2.0** or **ATOM** Formatted Feeds

This package can be used to generate feeds in either **RSS 1.0**, **RSS 2.0** or **ATOM** format.

Applications can create a feed object, several feed item objects, set several types of properties of either feed and feed items, and add items to the feed.

Once a feed is fully composed with its items, the feed class can generate the necessary XML structure to describe the feed in **RSS** or **ATOM** format. This structure can be directly sent to the browser, or just returned as string.
