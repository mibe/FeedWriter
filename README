This package can be used to generate feeds in either RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 or ATOM
formats.

There are three main classes that abstract the feed information and another to
encapsulate the feed items information.

Applications can create feed writer object, several feed item objects, set
several types of properties of either feeds and feed items, and add items to
the feed.

Once a feed is fully composed with its items, the feed writer class can generate
the necessary XML structure to describe the feed in the RSS or ATOM formats.
The feed is generated as part of the current feed output.
